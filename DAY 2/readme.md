<h1>Arrays in JavaScript</h1>

<h4><n JavaScript, array is a single variable that is used to store different elements. It is often used when we want to store list of elements and access them by a single variable. Unlike most languages where array is a reference to the multiple variable, in JavaScript array is a single variable that stores multiple elements./h4> 

Syntax:
var array_name = [item1,item2....];
